<font class="Default">Shooter on Skeleton King<br><br><br><hr>
Drones should be put on allies respectively deciding about which player is most usefull and or needs healing(Boss tank).<br><hr>
Shooter's ultimate is great Crowd Control handling spell, it stuns and silences respectively.<br>
You should use it as means to secure Stomp (25% 50% 75%) without other people sacrificing.<br>
<u>IMPORTANT</u>: Remember, during Comet Storm(F) you are immune to damage, but not immune to Instant Kill effect of Fall spell!<br><hr>
When Skeleton King uses Fall spell, use your W to make sure that people with drone dont get dragged in the middle of it.<br><hr>
Pay attention to Skeleton skills, your hero can counter them with W. Releasing Silenced allies or Stunned by pull ones.<hr><br>
Try to use W before using T, it happens often that you agro Skeleton with T resulting him in using Silence spell on you.<hr><br>
Try to stay as far as possible, your drones are all you need in terms of range.<hr><br>
Your T is amazing, you are not affected by Skeleton's Push spell while using it.<br>
You also dont get stunned when mini skeletons pulls you, but you are still getting your position changed.<br><hr>
If you are playing with Crimson Star, when using Q try to target allies that might need heal, the heal from Crimson Star empowered Q is roughly 2x INT per missle (4x INT if hit by two).
