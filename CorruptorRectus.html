Save your W to defend against Pudge's Corruption Wave.<br><hr>
If you plan on killing Stalkers, use your F just before they spawn to silence and slow them right away. This way you wont miss.<br><hr>
If any of enemy takes agro on you, run around the map while using your skills.<br><hr>
Remember to use your W just after Stalker's death, his explosion slows you down and makes vulnerable to Avenger.<br><hr>
Better use your T on Avenger than on Stalkers. He is of bigger potential danger.
