When he just stay and do nothing, prepare for blast in straight lane, so stay slighty off his aim.<br><hr>
Dont tank any of his spells, they deal too much for low gear.<br><hr>
Save your W to clean off Fear if he cast it.<br><hr>
Dont try to engage him in fight if he is in avatar form, he will kill you no matter what.<br><hr>
Your F wont prevent him into getting into avatar form. Unless you use it before 50%, so he is silenced.<br><hr>
Good practice is to use T before he is 50%, about 60%, this way he will start casting spell and wont enter his avatar form. Then just stun him with E and F to easily kill him.
