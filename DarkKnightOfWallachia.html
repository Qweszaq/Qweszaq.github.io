Use your W when he lands his first hit, or you hit him, this way you will block some of pull and first hits damage.<br><hr>
Try to use your R and T when he spawns shades, this 2 spells combined should kill them and make you relatively safe.<br><hr>
Start your combo with F, you might kill him before silence is off(since its weak boss).
