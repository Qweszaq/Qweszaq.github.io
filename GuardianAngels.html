If you are with teammates, dont be the one to lure angels, use your F about the time when he agro second angel, this way you will stun and hit all 3 relatively close.<br><hr>
Use your R as fast as possible, then E, your T is useless for these 3 if you are with team.<br><hr>
If you are alone, use your W when angel gets close to you and lands a hit, there is very big chance he will use Stun Pull, and this way you counter this.<br><hr>
Try to autoattack Angel on Avatar form, he might use up Anti Magic Shield without gaining anything.<br>
