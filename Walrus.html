Fight him only from range, or kill in one go if you can, if you get too close to him, he will knock you out to death with instadeath skill, regardless of gear.<br><hr>
Dont face him head on, if he use wave spell, its big range and there are many of them, try to run back in zigzac way.<br><hr>
Use your T only if you F'ed him before, else you might get knocked out.
