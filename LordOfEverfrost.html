Use your W to tank lich's Frost. If you cant survive even when using W, only use QE from range and wait with T till you have F.<br><hr>
Dont use your T nor F when lich has his Frost Armor up, its waste of damage.<br><hr>
Regardless what you do, after you have cooldown on spells, always run back, so lich and his minions dont kill you.<br><hr>
