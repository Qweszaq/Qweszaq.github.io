<font class="Default">Shooter on Shadow Dragon<br><br><br><hr>
Put drones on two people in your team who have biggest mortality rate.<br><hr>
You can give your allies third drone, but only if you are sure you wont die yourself.<br><hr>
Make use of your great range, you should have both side islands in your range easily.<br><hr>
If possible, try save your W for shadow dragons Breath(-100% healing).<br><hr>
Each time main Dragon uses mark, try to stun him at the end of skill cast.<br>
This way you earn important seconds for your W cooldown that you will most likely use after he cast it.<br><hr>
At third phase, give your orbs to melee autoattacking heros, so they can focus on autoattacking instead of dodging.
