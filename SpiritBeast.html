Give all your drones to Melee heros. They need it against Spirit Storm.<br><hr>
Use W just before Spirit Beast reach 40% to avoid initial 1s stun from Spirit Storm.<br><hr>
Use R as first spell of fight, using it on Spirit Storm is a waste since Debuff wont apply.<br><hr>
If you can, save your F for Spirit Storm, its safe way of Finishing things up and it cleans summoned Fairies and Driads easily.<br><hr>
If you have Drone on yourself or any item granting you shield and or resistance, try to use your T for Spirit Storm since you wont get stunned by it.<br><hr>
(Funny Tip) If you want to solo/duo spirit beast with shooter, start shooting spirit beast with E from up the hill, if your E aggro two fairies, wait a bit and clean them with T, since T have lower chance to get aggro of Spirit Beast.<br> You can also clean these two fairies with F.
