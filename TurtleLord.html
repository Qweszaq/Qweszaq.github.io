Give your drones and use W for Melee heros. They need it against Mini Blue Turtle's Bash stun.<br><hr>
Your T is better of to use on Healing Turtle, it prevents knockback and deals great damage if you position yourself on his way.<br><hr>
Remember, your W does NOT clean -armor stacks of Turtle Lord.<br><hr>
Save your R on Healing Turtle to slow him down, use it just before you go with your T.<br><hr>
None of your spells do damage to Mini Blue Turtles, if you want to use spells, use them on Mini Brown Turtles.<br><hr>
Your F is great to use when Mini Turtles Fall starts, or to stop Healing Turtle in track.<br> Saving it for finish is a waste.
