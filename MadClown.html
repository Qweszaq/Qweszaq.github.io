To start, use your Q to make him use clones, then use R to hit all 3 of them, then use Q again. Now he should make the pink circle so you will start moving opposite direction.<br><hr>
Use F when you see pink circle blink fast, use furthest E to stun him before balls from F lands to stun him.<br><hr>
T should be used after pink circle, also try to make him use Dodge ability before doing so.<br><hr>
Your W is good for tanking bullets from pink circle ability, and they make you immune to Wheel's stun(gold/red beams).<br>
