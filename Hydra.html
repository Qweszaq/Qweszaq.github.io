Use your W to counter pull after your first hit or hydra's first hit. This way you can block some damage from it and first hits.<br><hr>
If you have W and you are certain that hydra wont pull you (around 40s cooldown). Use it to clean yourself off fear.<br><hr>
Start with F and follow with R T and rest of combo if you think you can deal considerable damage before silence wears off.
