If you are still weak, kill all green Electric Elementals. They might hinder you in fight.<br><hr>
If you are weak, dont try to hold Keeper's skill with W, you have bigger chance to die than to shield it.<br><hr>
Be carefull when doing combo, try to make him use his skill before doing it, so you dont get swept out.<br><hr>
Use columns to counter knockback.
