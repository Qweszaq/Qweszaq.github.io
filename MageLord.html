Use your W when you get slowed by one of his skills/autoattack. This slow lasts long so better to clean it as fast as possible.<br><hr>
Dont stun him when he is casting ice wave, just dodge it and hit him meanwhile. He wont do anything to you.<br><hr>
When you see him using his nuke spell, get out of vision range, count to 5 and go back engage him in fight.<br><hr>
Dont fight him when you are lower than 50% hp, he use Lighting from around 400 units range that will kill you if you are not geared enough.
