<font class="Default">Shooter on Samiel<br><br><br><hr>
First of on samiel you need to take care of too many stuff, focus on supporting more than damaging if you are INT.<br><hr>
You will operate with 1-2 drones, always leave one for yourself. Put one drone on person which is Targeted by Mark skill(you need to change it everytime if target changes), and second drone on melee of your choice.<br><hr>
If possible, use your W when Mark skill takes effect, first 1-2 shots of this skill are always most crucial to be defended.<br><hr>
If possible, use your W when melee you gave orb is eating Samiel's Orbs skill.<br><hr>
Don't use your W to defend runes, its pointless<br><hr>
If you have crimson star, focus on using Q to heal ally, and not to damage boss.<br><hr>
When wheel starts, back all orbs to yourself with D, your allies might click on them and die by mistake.
