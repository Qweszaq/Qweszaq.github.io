Play her out on range, dont run left side since her aggro is further than this.<br><hr>
Use W just before you hit her/she hits you. This way you should tank a bit of her pull and first attacks damage.<br><hr>
Good idea is to stay on the other side of tombs when attacking her, if she pulls you, you will get stuck in tomb instead of getting in her range.<br><hr>
Use your T to counter pull, even if she pulls you, you wont get stunned (theoretically, sometimes doesnt work).
