<font class="Default">Shooter on Ancient Ent<br><br><br><hr>
Your hero is completely terrible on Ent, so just try to at least hold some main principles. --I will state two of them since i myself rarely take part in Ent runs.<br><hr>
Make sure you use Comet Storm(F) at first or third phase, using it on second phase will result in your death most likely.<br><hr>
Try to use W for Rock/Storm, its cooldown is really short, and under its effect you wont get stunned by the spell.
