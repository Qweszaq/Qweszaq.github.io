<font class="Default">Shooter on Zombie Lord<br><br><br><hr>
Give your orb to two heros with lowest amount of HP.<br><hr>
If you see Infection skill spread, use your W after 1-2 seconds delay.<br>
This way your spell will not only clear poison, but also shield off Infection Explosion later.<br><hr>
Use your W to clear Posion when zombie starts rejuvenating, cooldown for this skill is low enough for you to get it back on time for Infection.<br><hr>
There is trick to swap orb to someone else directly after using W, this way you can shield 3, and start healing other 3 at same time.<br><hr>
If Zombie spread Infection and you have your T spell active, you wont get Infected even if green projectile hits you.<br><hr>
If one of your allies gets -60% healing or more, make sure to use W spell on him to clean negative effect.
