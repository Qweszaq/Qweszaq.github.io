You can hit Flame Nightmare with Q without being seen = no agro. <br>It means you can make him jump without being seen.<br><hr>
If you dribble, use shortest E possible to stun.<br><hr>
Use your W just before Flame Nightmare lands on target, to absorb as much damage into shield as possible.<br><hr>
If you are helping kiter, use E if he needs it.<br>
